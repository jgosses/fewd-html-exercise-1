                IN <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">"CONTENT Display Patterns"</a> 
                (which all front-end folk should read), Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one 
                <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/">Ethan Marcotte shared last month</a> on 24 ways. 
                It is a truth as old as standards-based design: Construct your markup to properly support your content (not your design).
                </p>
                <p>
                Modular/<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom. 
                <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">grid layout</a>
                don’t change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better. 
                <a href="http://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html">HTML5</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came into existence for a reason. 
                A reason that hasn’t changed. 
                A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                Separating structure from style and behavior was the web standards movement’s prime revelation, and each generation of web designers discovers it anew. 
                This separation is what makes our content as backward-compatible as it is forward-compatible (or <a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">“future-friendly,”</a> if you prefer). 
                It’s the key to re-use. The key to accessibility. 
                The key to the new kinds of CMS systems we’re just beginning to dream up. 
                It’s what makes our content as accessible to an ancient device as it will be to an unimagined future one.
